Jayu is licenced under new BSD licence and can be used in both 
free and proprietary projects. Jayu is bundled with Janino library 
so that it can also be used as a command line tool.

If you intend to use JAYU programatically, then you will only require jayu.jar (~35 kb) 
the Janino files commons-compiler.jar/janino.jar are then not needed.
